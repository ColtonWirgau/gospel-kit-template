# Contributing Guidelines

## Before You Start

1. Read the relevant convention docs for your work area
2. Understand the [Git Workflow](./workflows/git.md)
3. Ask questions early - don't assume

## Development Setup

See [SETUP.md](../SETUP.md) in the project root for environment setup.

## Code Standards

### General Principles

- **Clarity over cleverness** - Write code that's easy to read and maintain
- **Consistency** - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- **Small changes** - Keep PRs focused and reviewable
- **Document decisions** - If you make a non-obvious choice, add a comment explaining why

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code follows the relevant [conventions](./conventions/)
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] No console.log or debug code left behind
- [ ] Self-reviewed the diff for obvious issues

## Communication

- Use descriptive commit messages (see [Git Workflow](./workflows/git.md))
- Tag relevant people in PR descriptions when needed
- If blocked, communicate early rather than spinning

## Questions or Suggestions

If you see something that could be improved in these docs or the codebase, bring it up. We value feedback from everyone on the team.
